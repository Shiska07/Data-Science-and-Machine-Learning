This program uses a Decision Tree and a Random Forest model to predict whether a member is likely to pay back a loan on not depending on attributes pertinent to the member's profile.

Results obtained using a single decision tree is compared with results obtained after using a random forest model. The classification report and confusin matrix results show that the radom forest model outperforms the decision tree model on the test dataset.
